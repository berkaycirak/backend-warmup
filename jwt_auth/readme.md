`app.use()` is a method in Express that adds middleware to the application's request processing pipeline. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle, usually denoted by a variable named `next`.

Here's a breakdown of what `app.use()` does:

1. It mounts specified middleware function(s) at the specified path.
2. If no path is specified, the middleware is executed for every request to the app.

Common use cases for `app.use()`:

1. Applying global middleware:

```javascript
app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming JSON payloads
```

2. Mounting router-level middleware:

```javascript
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');
app.use('/auth', authRoutes);
```

3. Error handling:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
	console.error(err.stack);
	res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

4. Serving static files:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

In the context of authentication, you might use `app.use()` to apply authentication middleware to specific routes or to your entire application.
